Below, you can find a list of suggestions for articles to revise.

-   [Wasserstein barycenters](Wasserstein_Barycenters.qmd) - This article should mention [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06838) on barycenters with positive and negative weights.
- The following two articles have a lot of overlap and should be merged: [Formal Riemannian Structure](RiemannianStructureOriginal.qmd), [Riemannian Structure Wasserstein Space](Riemannian_Structure_Wasserstein_Space.qmd)
-   [Gradient flows on Hilbert Spaces](GFHilbert.qmd) - The organization of this article could be greatly improved. Currently, there is an over emphacsis on the Moreau Yosida regularization. Also, the other wiki article on the MY regularization should be cited. The latex formatting could be improved throughout. The statements in the Examples and Applications section could be made more rigorous and more organized.
- [Machine Learning and Optimal Transport](MachineLearning.qmd) - This article should probably be reinvisioned as a high level summary, with links to specific applications.

Articles with formatting issues that need to be fixed, particularly in the equations and references: 

- [Monge Problem](Monge.qmd) 

- [Regularity of Optimal Transport Maps](RegularityOTMap.qmd)

- [1-Wasserstein Metric and Generalizations](1Wasserstein.qmd)

- [Geodesics and Generalized Geodesics](GeoGenGeo.qmd)

- [Equivalence of W2 and H-1](W2Hm1.qmd)

- [Auction Algorithm](AuctionAlgorithm.qmd)

- [Semidiscrete Optimal Transport](Semidiscrete.qmd)

- [Dual Space of C0 vs Cb](DualSpaceCtsFns.qmd)

- [Convergence of Measures and Metrizability](ConvergenceMetrizability.qmd)

- [Fenchel Moreau](FenchelMoreau.qmd)

- [Fenchel Rockafellar](FenchelRockafellar.qmd)

- [Moreau Yosida Regularization](MoreauYosida.qmd)

- [Continuity Equation and Benamou Brenier](CtyEqn.qmd)

- [Isoperimetric Inequality](Isoperimetric.qmd)

- [Shallow Neural Networks as W2 GFs](ShallowNeuralNetworks.qmd)
