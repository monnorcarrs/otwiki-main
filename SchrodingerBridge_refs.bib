	abstract = {This paper is about Girsanov’s theory. It (almost) doesn’t contain new results but it is based on a simpliﬁed new approach which takes advantage of the (weak) extra requirement that some relative entropy is ﬁnite. Under this assumption, we present and prove all the standard results pertaining to the absolute continuity of two continuoustime processes on Rd with or without jumps. We have tried to give as much as possible a self-contained presentation.},

	abstract = {We consider a general class of problems of the minimization of convex integral functionals subject to linear constraints. Using Fenchel duality, we prove the equality of the values of the minimization problem and its associated dual problem. This equality is a variational criterion for the existence of a solution to a large class of inverse problems entering the class of generalized Fredholm integral equations. In particular, our abstract results are applied to marginal problems for stochastic processes. Such problems naturally arise from the probabilistic approaches to quantum mechanics.},
